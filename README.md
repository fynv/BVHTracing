# BVHTracing

My test code trying to bring ray-tracing to OpenGL.

* BVHTracing.cpp : ray-tracing using [https://github.com/madmann91/bvh](https://github.com/madmann91/bvh)
* BVHTracing2.cpp : ray-tracing using code under "flex_bvh" folder, which is a minimalism transcription of [https://github.com/jan-van-bergen/GPU-Raytracer](https://github.com/jan-van-bergen/GPU-Raytracer)
    - test1(): CPU ray-tracing using BVH2
    - test2(): OpenGL (compute shader) ray-tracing using BVH8 (CWBVH)
